# Fajr Iqamah Time Calculator

This simple JavaScript utility calculates the Fajr iqamah time based on the sunrise time.  
It ensures that the iqamah time is **at least 15 minutes before** the sunrise.

## üìå Features

- Accepts sunrise time in "HH:mm" (24-hour) format.                                                                 
- Rounds down to the nearest 15-minute block before sunrise.                                                        
- Ensures a **minimum 15-minute gap** between iqamah and sunrise.                                                   
- Returns the iqamah time in "HH:mm" 12-hour format with leading zeros.

## üß† Logic                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                    
1. Convert `sunriseTime` (e.g., "06:40") to total minutes from midnight.                                            
2. Round down to the **nearest 15-minute block before sunrise**.
3. If the time difference is less than 15 minutes, subtract **another 15 minutes**.
4. Convert back to 12-hour format and return.
